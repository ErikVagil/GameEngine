# GameEngine
Not a full game engine, but a personal project I made to explore the LWJGL Java library and to learn about 3D graphics.

I dumped all of the files from Eclipse into this repository, so it's probably going to look messy. This is more just to display the code and the project on my account. I also would've uploaded an executable Jar file if the libraries and natives I used weren't so depricated and painful. :)
